# Cerence Frontend Challenge

## The task

Write a React application to display a list of users, with a panel showing the selected user's details.
Also, it should be responsive enough to be used from a phone.

Bonus points:
Implement a searchbar to perform search within the list of users.

## The data

**_ PLEASE DO NOT BUILD YOUR OWN BACKEND _**

You have to use this REST API to perform requests: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users (only use users)
Feel free to follow this guide: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/

## Getting started

**To help you out, the project scaffolding with React, CSS, bundling (Parcel), Babel (ES7), and hot module reloading is already setup**

To install the dependancies

```
npm install
```

To run your app

```
npm run start
```

This scaffolding is there to help you get started and not spend time on boilerplate. You can add external libraries at your own will.

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated on:

- Code architecture
- User experience
- Best practices

Try to take a maximum of _1 hour_ to complete this test, spending too much time on it will not give you bonus points.
You will have to make choices on what to focus on and we know you can't make a perfect solution in this time lapse. We are interested to see where you will choose to spend your time.
We will then review your solution together as part of the interview.

**Please do not forget to run `clean.sh` (see below) or at least delete the _/node_modules/_ and _/dist/_ directories before sending us back a compressed folder with your source code.**

```
# From terminal (unix) or Git Bash (windows)
sh ./clean.sh
```

Good luck and looking forward to meet you ✌️
